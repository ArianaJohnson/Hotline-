 This program is a mental health check designed for students of a university (though may be changed to reflect community use).
 Takes multiple inputs of individuals asking quesions from the DSM-5 diagnosis criteria based inquries. 
 At the end of each entry, the console will ask the user if they want someone to contact them regarding their well being.
 All this data will be exported to two different files. One holding all given data (for tracking and training purposes),
 and one specifically for the students who wish to be contacted.
